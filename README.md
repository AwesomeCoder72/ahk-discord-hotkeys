# ahk-discord-hotkeys
Some AutoHotKey scripts that can make using discord a bit nicer.

## How To Use
For now, install the exe from [src](https://github.com/AwesomeCoder72/ahk-discord-hotkeys/tree/main/src). Then run it. There may be a windows safeguard warning or something like that, so if you feel uncomfortable running it that way, [Download AutoHotKey](https://www.autohotkey.com/), and run the ahk scripts.
